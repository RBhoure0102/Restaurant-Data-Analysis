# Restaurant-Data-Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a restaurant dataset to uncover trends in customer preferences, restaurant ratings, cuisine popularity, and geographic distribution. It includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization steps to reveal insights such as factors affecting ratings and popular cuisine types. The analysis is implemented using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

### Restaurant Data Analysis Level 1

This Level focuses on basic exploratory data analysis of the restaurant dataset, helping to understand cuisines, locations, pricing, and services at a high level

### Task 1 : Top Cuisines
Find the three most common cuisines and what percentage of restaurants serve them, to understand overall cuisine popularity.

### Task 2 : City Analysis
Identify which city has the most restaurants and compare average ratings across cities to see where restaurant presence and quality are highest.

### Task 3 : Price Range Distribution
Examine how restaurants are spread across price ranges using charts and percentages to understand affordability and market segments.

### Restaurant Data Analysis Level 2

This level focuses on deeper, more advanced analysis of the restaurant dataset, moving beyond basic summaries to patterns, relationships, and structures

### Task 1 Restaurant Ratings:
Examines how ratings are distributed, finds the most common rating range, and calculates the average number of votes, giving insight into overall quality and customer engagement.

### Task 2 : Cuisine Combination
Looks at which cuisine combinations appear most often and whether some combinations receive higher ratings, helping to understand popular and successful fusion or pairing trends.​

### Task 3 : Geographic Analysis
Uses longitude and latitude to map restaurant locations and identify spatial clusters or patterns, revealing hotspots and concentration areas.​

### Task 4 : Restaurant Chains
Detects restaurant chains in the data and compares their ratings and popularity, helping to evaluate how chains perform relative to others in the market.​

 






### Task 4 : Online Delivery
Measure how many restaurants offer online delivery and compare their average ratings with those that do not, to see if delivery is linked with better or worse ratings.
